# Webscraping-Stock-Data-using-Python
A Python project for extracting and analyzing stock data through web scraping using BeautifulSoup, focusing on historical financial data retrieval from web pages


This repository contains a Python project focused on extracting and analyzing stock data through web scraping. By utilizing libraries such as `BeautifulSoup`, this project retrieves historical financial data directly from web pages, providing an alternative when data is not available via APIs.


## Introduction

In the financial world, obtaining accurate and timely data is crucial for analysis and decision-making. While APIs are often the go-to for data retrieval, not all financial data is readily available through these means. This project demonstrates how to use web scraping techniques to extract stock data, focusing on historical financial information. The project employs Python's `BeautifulSoup` library for parsing HTML and extracting the required data.

## Features

- Scrape stock data from web pages.
- Extract historical stock price data.
- Convert scraped data into structured formats like Pandas DataFrames.
- Visualize stock trends using `Plotly`.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install requests
pip install bs4
pip install html5lib
pip install lxml
pip install plotly
```


## Examples

### Downloading and Parsing Web Pages

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# URL of the webpage to scrape
url = 'https://example.com/stockdata'

# Send a GET request to the webpage
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Extract relevant data
data = soup.find_all('div', class_='stock-data')
```

### Converting Data to Pandas DataFrame

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example: Extracting specific data points and converting to a DataFrame
data_points = [point.text for point in data]
df = pd.DataFrame(data_points, columns=['Stock Data'])
print(df.head())
```

### Visualizing Data

```python
import plotly.express as px

# Example: Plotting historical stock prices
fig = px.line(df, x='Date', y='Close', title='Historical Stock Prices')
fig.show()
```
